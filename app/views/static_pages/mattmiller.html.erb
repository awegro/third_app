<p>	"Suppose I told you that for just two cents on the national dollar we could have a country where everyone had health insurance, every full-time worker earned a living wage, every poor child had a great teacher in a fixed-up school, and politicians spent their time with average Americans because they no longer had to grovel to wealthy donors? Suppose I also said we'd largely be using 'conservative' means (like tax subsidies and vouchers) to reach these seemingly 'liberal' goals â€” and that when we were done, government would be smaller than it was when Ronald Reagan was president?"
